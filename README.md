# Poisson Solver

**Poisson Solver** is a Python implementation of a finite difference method to solve the 2D Poisson equation on a rectangular domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

---

## ðŸ§© Overview

This project builds a solver **from scratch** for the Poisson equation

\[
-\Delta u = f
\]

on the rectangular domain

\[
[0, L_x] \times [0, L_y]
\]

with prescribed Dirichlet boundary data, using a finite difference discretization.
